# Automated Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

Welcome to DragAI, an automated machine learning application designed to simplify the process of data analysis and model creation. This app allows users to upload their own datasets or import directly from Kaggle, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess data, and build neural networks for regression or classification tasksâ€”all without writing a single line of code.

## Features

- **Upload Dataset**: Easily upload your dataset from local files or import directly from Kaggle.
- **EDA Report**: Generate an insightful EDA report instantly to understand your data better.
- **Preprocessing**: Perform essential preprocessing tasks like encoding, standardization, and outlier detection with just a click.
- **Model Building**: Automatically create and train neural networks for regression or classification tasks.
- **Results Visualization**: View the performance and results of your models in an easy-to-understand format.
